DescForApprovalAll=All approvers set up must approve artwork to enable user to get to the next stage
DescForApprovalAny=Should you have more than one user set up as an approver as long as one of the approvers approve an artwork/campaign/cart, the artwork will be marked as approved.
DescForApprovalHierarchy=Should your subsites be set up in a hierarchy level the approval process will start at the lower level of the hierarchy and then make its way up the chain. Example, you may have a head office level and state levels. An approver will be set up in each state, and in head office. For instance, should a user in NSW create an artwork, the NSW approver will receive an approval request notification. Once the NSW approver has approved the artwork, the head office approver will receive an approval request notification.  Should the state approver reject artwork for any reason, head office will not receive any notification of this.
